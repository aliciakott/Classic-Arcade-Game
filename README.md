# Udacity Arcade Game Clone
Use your arrow keys (left, down, right, up) to navigate your player through the field, but don't touch any bugs!

If your player reaches the water without touching any bugs, you win!

## Getting Started
Clone or download the files to your local repository and open index.html on the browser of your choice.

## Dependencies
This game relies on the Google Fonts open-use library, accessed remotely via an external stylesheet link.

Please check that the app.js, engine.js, and resources.js files are located in the js folder

and the style.css file is in the css folder.



If any of these files are moved or missing, the game will not behave as expected.
